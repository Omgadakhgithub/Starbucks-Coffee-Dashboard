# Overview :

This dashboard is for presenting my insights to the regional manager of the coffee chain with 3 different stores.I have created a dashboard which can help me discuss the operations of these stores with my higher-ups. This will be done solely to optimize the operations.

#### **1. Revenue & Profit Trends**
- **Monthly Revenue Growth:**  
  - Revenue shows a **consistent upward trend** each month, with a **significant spike in March**.
  - This suggests **seasonality** in customer demand—potentially linked to promotions, holidays, or product launches.
- **Profit Margins:**  
  - The net profit margin remains steady, with **January generating the highest profit**.
  - The business should analyze why certain months are performing better and replicate the strategies in lower-revenue months.

#### **2. Product Popularity & Performance**
- **Best-Selling Products:**  
  - **Brewed Chai Tea** (26,250 units, $77,081 revenue) and **Gourmet Brewed Coffee** (25,973 units, $70,034 revenue) are the top sellers.
  - **Barista Espresso** follows closely, indicating strong demand for **classic coffee choices**.
- **Low-Performing Products:**  
  - **Gourmet Beans** (366 units, $6,798 revenue) and **Espresso Beans** (319 units, $5,560 revenue) have the lowest sales.
  - This suggests **a lower demand for take-home coffee products** compared to ready-to-drink options.

#### **3. Customer Traffic & Sales Patterns**
- **Day-wise Transactions:**
  - **Weekdays have consistent sales**, with a peak on **Mondays** (21,643 transactions).
  - **Sundays see slightly lower sales**, possibly indicating different customer behavior on weekends.
- **Hourly Trends:**
  - **Morning Peak:** Sales **surge between 7 AM – 10 AM**, highlighting the importance of breakfast and morning coffee.
  - **Evening Slowdown:** Transactions decline post **5 PM**, suggesting that Starbucks is primarily a morning and midday destination.

#### **4. Store Performance & Location Impact**
- **High-performing stores should be identified** to replicate their success in underperforming locations.
- **Lower Manhattan has strong sales** (as seen in transactions data), indicating a preference for Starbucks in high-traffic business areas.

#### **5. Business Recommendations**

  - Implement **targeted promotions for evening hours** to boost sales during slow periods.
- **Expand Popular Products:**  
  - Introduce **new flavors or promotions** for best-sellers like Brewed Chai Tea.

# Data Story :
I have noticed that the bottom products for all the stores include some flavours and other products like coffee beans. Also, the merchandise clothing for Hell's Kitchen is way less as compared to other stores. We shall provide some discount offers to this store to increase sales. Or else completely remove it from displaying at this store and keep it available on order only. This shall help us reduce costs of operations.
